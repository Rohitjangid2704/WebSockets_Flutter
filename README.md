# WebSocket Flutter App

## Description

This Flutter application connects to a WebSocket, receives real-time data streams, and displays the latest stock price in a user-friendly interface. The app is designed to handle live updates efficiently and presents the data in a clean and organized manner.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Connects to the Binance WebSocket to fetch live stock price updates.
- **User Interface**: Displays the latest stock prices in a list format, updating in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: Manages WebSocket errors and parsing issues gracefully.
- **Performance**: Optimized for responsiveness and efficient data handling.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohitjangid2704/WebSockets_Flutter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Flutter installed. Run the following command to get the required packages:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**

   To launch the app on an emulator or physical device, use:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

The app connects to the WebSocket endpoint at `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/!miniTicker@arr` to receive real-time stock data. It displays each stock's symbol and its current price in a list view.

## Code Overview

- **`main.dart`**: Contains the main entry point of the Flutter application. Sets up the WebSocket connection and builds the UI.
- **`StreamBuilder`**: Used to listen to the WebSocket stream and update the UI with the latest data.
- **`ListView.builder`**: Efficiently builds the list of stock prices for display.

## Performance Metrics

- **UI Responsiveness**: The application is designed to update the UI only when new data is received, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Memory Management**: Resources are disposed of properly to prevent memory leaks.

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Verify your internet connection and WebSocket URL.
- **Data Parsing Errors**: Ensure the WebSocket data format matches the expected JSON structure.
